#  Healthcare Wait List Dashboard Development

This project presents an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** built to visualize and analyze patient wait list data modeled after the UK‚Äôs **National Health Service (NHS)** structure. The dashboard focuses on understanding healthcare service demand, wait times, and specialty-specific insights across different age groups and case types.

## üìä Project Overview

The dashboard provides a clear visual summary of key healthcare indicators including:

-  **Wait List Trends** (2018‚Äì2021)
-  **Case Types**: Outpatient, Day Case, and Inpatient
-  **Age Profiles**: 0‚Äì15, 16‚Äì64, 65+
-  **Time Bands**: Distribution of patients by waiting period
-  **Top 5 Medical Specialties** by volume
-  **Monthly Changes** and Case Type Comparisons

This project was created as part of my self-learning journey using **Power BI Desktop**, guided by a YouTube tutorial, to enhance my skills in data visualization and healthcare analytics.
