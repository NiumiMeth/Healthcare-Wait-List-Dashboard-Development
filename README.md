# 🏥 Healthcare Wait List Dashboard Development

This project presents an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** built to visualize and analyze patient wait list data modeled after the UK’s **National Health Service (NHS)** structure. The dashboard focuses on understanding healthcare service demand, wait times, and specialty-specific insights across different age groups and case types.

## 📊 Project Overview

The dashboard provides a clear visual summary of key healthcare indicators including:

- 📅 **Wait List Trends** (2018–2021)
- 🏥 **Case Types**: Outpatient, Day Case, and Inpatient
- 🧓 **Age Profiles**: 0–15, 16–64, 65+
- ⏳ **Time Bands**: Distribution of patients by waiting period
- 🩺 **Top 5 Medical Specialties** by volume
- 📈 **Monthly Changes** and Case Type Comparisons

This project was created as part of my self-learning journey using **Power BI Desktop**, guided by a YouTube tutorial, to enhance my skills in data visualization and healthcare analytics.
